# Algorithm_Practice
My work for "5003CEM Advanced Algorithms"


These are some the algorithms we looked at during 5003CEM.
They were given as pseudocode, and we were tasked to implement them, and then to expalin them.
I also have gone out of my way to time them, and to create a simple list generator to serve as input.
This repository will be updated as soon as I optimise any algorithm posted in here.
